###The Rainbow, the Unicorn and the Pony
<hr>
*<p align="center">
Today is Earth Day.   
Not Mars Day. 
Purple rain 
is present on the mountaintops  
It's not pink   
It's not orange either  
Blue is cold   
Green means money 
Indigo is underappreciated
Recycle!    
Yellow is a smelly color  
Red is hot    
These are the colors of the rainbow. 
And the unicorn.
